      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-100 leading-relaxed">
        I started in advertising and behaviour-driven campaigns, moved into
        medical awareness and personalised communication, and then into
        architecting AI-native ecosystems. My work now lives where cognition,
        markets, and infrastructure meet: real estate intelligence, security
        traps, AI memory models, and learning systems.

        I don’t chase products. I chase structures. If a system can’t explain
        itself, it’s not finished. ezz.ae is the beginning of turning everything
        I’ve been building — Forgetence, NotefullBook, AIXSELF, DLDCHAIN,
        Luredoor, BruteBrains, and more — into a coherent, teachable,
        open-intelligence field.
