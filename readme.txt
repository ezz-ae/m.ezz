This patch fixes mobile menu overlap, notebook text overflow, and improves general responsiveness.
Instructions:
1. Copy the CSS from 'mobile_patch.css' into your main/global CSS file or import it.
2. Add 'mobile_patch.js' and ensure it is loaded in your project (before </body> is fine).
3. The patch also includes minor recommended improvements for better mobile UX.
