This patch fixes mobile menu overlay, notebook text overflow, and improves general mobile responsiveness.
Instructions:
1. Copy the CSS from 'mobile_patch.css' into your main/global CSS file or import it.
2. Add 'mobile_patch.js' and ensure it is loaded in your project (before </body> is fine).
3. The patch includes smooth transitions and prevents scrolling behind the mobile menu.
